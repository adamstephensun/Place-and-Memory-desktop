# Place-and-Memory-desktop
## About
Desktop version of my installation for the Place and Memory exhibition at Phoenix Cinema and Arts Centre, Leicester, UK.

Initially designed to be interacted with using a Microbit V2 microcomputer in an exhibition setting, this version is to be used either as an idle screen or with user interaction on PC or mobile.

Starts in idle mode where everything is randomised on a cycle, designed to be displayed on the media wall at Phoenix.
